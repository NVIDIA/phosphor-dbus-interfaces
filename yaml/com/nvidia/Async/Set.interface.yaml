    Do an asynchronous set property operation. If an Object has this Interface,
    its Set Method can be used to perform an asynchronous set property
    operation. The Set Method will return an Object Path. Interface
    com.nvidia.Async.Status at this returned Object Path can be used to retrieve
    the status of the set property operation.
