  Implement to describe the format of histogram supported by the object.

properties:
  - name: NumOfBuckets
    type: uint64
    default: 0
    description: >
      This represents number of buckets/bins availble in the histogram.
  - name: MinSamplingTime
    type: uint64
    default: 0
    description: >
      This represents the shortest time of sampling this histogram in millisec.
  - name: AccumulationCycle
    type: uint64
    default: 0
    description: >
      This represents the accumulation cycle of this histogram.
  - name: IncrementDuration
    type: uint64
    default: 0
    description: >
      This represents the time duration of an increment in the buckets in Âµsec (0 = runtime value).
  - name: UnitOfMeasure
    type: enum[self.BucketUnits]
    description: >
      This represents the unit of data/value stored in the buckets of histogram.
  - name: BucketDataType
    type: byte
    default: 0
    description: >
      This represents the data type of bucket information.

enumerations:

          When data in buckets is represented in percentage.
      - name: Count
        description: >
          When data in buckets is represented in counts.
