    Customer requested system clock speed mode.

properties:
    - name: ClockMode
      type: enum[self.Mode]
      default: Static
      description: >
          This property shall contain the computer system clock mode setting.
          This defines the processor speed based on the priority of power
          consumption and performance.

          Possible Clock Mode settings
      values:
          - name: BalancedPerformance
            decription: >
                The system performs at the highest speeds while utilization is
                high and performs at reduced speeds when the utilization is low.
          - name: EfficiencyFavorPerformance
            decription: >
                The system performs at reduced speeds at all utilizations to
                save power while attempting to maintain performance. This mode
                differs from EfficiencyFavorPower in that more performance is
                retained but less power is saved.
          - name: EfficiencyFavorPower
            decription: >
                The system performs at reduced speeds at all utilizations to
                save power at the cost of performance. This mode differs from
                PowerSaving in that more performance is retained and less power
                is saved. This mode differs from EfficiencyFavorPerformance in
                that less performance is retained but more power is saved.
          - name: MaximumPerformance
            decription: >
                This value shall indicate the system performs at the highest
                speeds possible. This mode should be used when performance is
                the top priority.
          - name: OEM
            description: >
                This value shall indicate the system performs at an OEM-defined
                power mode.
          - name: PowerSaving
            description: >
                This value shall indicate the system performs at reduced speeds
                to save power. This mode should be used when power saving is the
                top priority.
          - name: Static
            description: >
                This value shall indicate the system performs at a static base
                speed.
