          Valid socket types in the UNIX domain are SOCK_STREAM for a
          stream-oriented socket, SOCK_DGRAM for a datagram oriented socket and
          SOCK_SEQPACKET for a sequenced-packet socket that is connection
          oriented.

      type: int16

      default: 0
      description: >
          The protocol sepcifies a particular protocol to be used with the
          socket. Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular
          socket type within a given protocol family, in which case protocol can
          be specified as 0.

    - name: Address
      type: array[byte]
      description: >
          The address to which the UNIX domain socket is bound. Address can be
          null-terminated filesystem pathname, empty if it is unnamed or if it
          is abstract socket the first byte is null byte('\0') followed by the
          socket address.
