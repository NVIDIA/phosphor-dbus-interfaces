    Provides SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) using key-based authentication.
    Transfers from remote server to local path. Supports one transfer at a time.

methods:
    - name: DownloadViaSCP
      description: >
          Starts an on-demand service which runs a shell script to perform the SCP and to update
          the three properties below accordingly.
          Dropbear SCP will be used for transfering the file. In order to avoid any interaction sessions, the user
          is required to:
          1. Use AddRemoteServerPublicKey to add the remote server public key to the BMC's known_host file.
          2. Use GenerateSelfKeyPair to receive BMC root's public key and add it to the remote server's
          authorized_keys file.
          Only one transfer is allowed at a time. Throws a NotAllowed error in case of initiating 
          a request while a transfer is already in progress.
