    Implement to provide UEFI Secure Boot Database Signature management
    features.

    UEFI Secure Boot Database Signature is digital signature of the boot
    loaders, drivers, and other essential components of the system. UEFI Secure
    Boot Database maintains lists of signautres, including  signatures of code
    that is authorized to run on the platform and signatures of code that is
    forbidden. An OpenBMC implementation providing UEFI Secre Boot Database
    Signature management functions. An implementation service should
    additionally implement xyz.openbmc_project.Object.Delete to allow the
    deletion of individual signature objects.
