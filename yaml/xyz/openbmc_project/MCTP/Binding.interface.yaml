    Describe an MCTP transport binding. An MCTP controller (typically the bus
    owner) may implement this interface on the MCTP endpoints that it discovers
    to indicate the MCTP transport binding properties used for communications to
    that endpoint.

    - name: BindingType
      type: enum[self.BindingTypes]
      description: >
          BindingType is the type of transport binding that will be used by the
          MCTP controller when communicating to an endpoint as described in the
          Endpoint interface. This differs from the MediumType property in that
          the MediumType property describes the physical bus connected to the
          endpoint whereas this property will describe the binding used by the
          bus owner while transmitting and receiving MCTP packets.
