properties:
    - name: SensorMetrics
      type: dict[string, struct[double, path, uint64]]
      description: >
          A map that stores mapping from sensor name to its value,
          chassis path and timestamp when the sensor reading got refreshed
    - name: StaleSensorUpperLimitms
      type: uint32
      description: >
          Time interval in miliseconds to calculate the staleness of a sensor. This metric 
          will be common to all the sensor for a given platform
