    The LeakDetection schema contains definitions for reporting leaks in liquid cooling systems or other equipment.
    The LeakDetector schema describes a state-based or digital-value leak detector and its properties.
    Implement LeakDetectorState interface to indicate the state of the LeakDetector.

properties:
    - name: DetectorState
      type: enum[self.DetectorStateEnum]
      default: OK
      description: >
          The current state of the Leak Detector and is a read-only property.
      flags:
          - readonly
    - name: LeakDetectorType
      type: enum[self.LeakDetectorTypeEnum]
      default: Moisture
      description: >
          This property shall contain the reading type of the leak detection sensor.
      flags:
          - readonly

enumerations:
  - name: DetectorStateEnum
    description: >
      The state of the Leak Detector enum.
    values:
      - name: OK
        description: >
         The state of the Leak Detector is OK.
