          BootProgressLastUpdate is the last time the BootProgress property was
          updated. The time is the Epoch time, number of microseconds since 1
          Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC. This can be compared with the current
          BootProgress value to know how long the boot has been on the current
          boot step.

        This property will be mapped to Redfish OemLastState property.
