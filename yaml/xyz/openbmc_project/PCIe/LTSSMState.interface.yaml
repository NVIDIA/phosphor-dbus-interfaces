enumerations:
    - name: State
      description: >
          Represents Different States of LTSSSMState.
      values:
          - name: Detect
            description: >
                . Detect state, where the system determines the presence of a receiver at the end of the link by 
                  sending electrical signals from the transmitter.
          - name: Polling
            description: >
                . This state occurs when the LTSSM continuously polls the link partner to determine its current state. 
          - name: Configuration
            description: >
                . The Configuration state focuses on setting the link width and the number of lanes through the downstream and upstream ports. 
                  It ensures that both ends of the link are synchronized and prepared for efficient data transmission.
          - name: Recovery
            description: >
                . This state manages data rate negotiation, ensuring a stable and adaptable link
          - name: RecoveryEQ
            description: >
                . RecoveryEQ is a state in the operation of a PCI Express (PCIe) device where the link is in a recovery state
                  due to equalization issues.
          - name: L0
            description: >
                . LTSSM enters the L0 state, a fully operational state where the link is ready to operate at peak capacity.
                  This is where high-speed data exchange occurs
          - name: L0s
            description: >
                . L0s is a power-saving mode that optimizes power consumption while keeping the link active.
          - name: L1
            description: >
                . This is a low-power state where the link is partially or fully powered down to conserve energy when data transmission is not required. 
          - name: L1_PLL_PD
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link has entered a low-power mode known as "L1" with the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) power down.
          - name: L2
            description: >
                . This is an even lower power state compared to L1, where the link is in a deeper sleep mode to further reduce power consumption.
          - name: L1_CPM
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link has entered a low-power mode known as "L1" with the Clock Power Management (CPM) enabled.
          - name: L1_1
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link is in the "L1" low-power state with a specific sub-state denoted as 1.
          - name: L1_2
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link is in the "L1" low-power state with a specific sub-state denoted as 2.
          - name: HotReset
            description: >
                . Hot Reset state provides a recovery mechanism that can be initiated by software or by receiving specific signals. 
          - name: Loopback
            description: >
                . The Loopback state serves as a valuable testing and debugging tool. It allows one device to act as a master and 
                  the other as a slave, simplifying in-depth troubleshooting. 
          - name: Disabled
            description: >
                . In the Disable state, all lanes transmit 16 to 32 TS1s with the disable bit asserted and 
                  send 2 EIOS (End of Idle Ordered Set) to transition to electrical idle. 
          - name: LinkDown
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link is not established or has been disconnected, indicating a loss of link
                  connectivity between the PCIe devices.
          - name: LinkReady
            description: >
                . In this state, the PCIe link is established and ready for data transmission between the PCIe devices.
          - name: LanesInSleep
            description: >
                .  In this state, some or all of the lanes in the PCIe link are in a low-power sleep mode, while other lanes may remain active.
          - name: IllegalState
            description: >
                . In this state, the link is in an unexpected or illegal configuration or condition that violates the PCIe specification.
          - name: NA
            description: >
                . value not available
